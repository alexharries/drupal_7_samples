This module has:

# A variety of helper functions that can be used by other modules / themes.
# Some theme support functions (because there are certain hooks that require a module to implement, even though display logic is technically part of the theme layer)

Please be careful not to let this module get too cluttered. It is not a catch-all for disparate features. Always consider whether you should write a new module, instead of putting your code in here.
