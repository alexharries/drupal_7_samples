; If you want to mark this pod as being disabled, uncomment the following line.

; disabled = 1

; If you want to specify that this pod should only be shown on certain paths,
; uncomment and modify the following lines as necessary. You can use the
; same format for specifying paths here as the Block module uses for block
; visibility by path.

; paths[] = node/123
; paths[] = monkey/*
; paths[] = admin
; paths[] = admin/*

; If you want to specify one or more preprocess functions for this pod,
; you need to place them in a .inc file in this pod's directory. In the example
; below, the include file is example__disabled.inc (you should always use .inc
; as the file extension), and the preprocess functions are
; communication_pod_example__inc_preprocess_1 and
; communication_pod_example__inc_preprocess_2. Preprocess functions will be
; run in the order they are listed here.

; preprocess_file = example__disabled.inc
; preprocess_functions[] = communication_pod_example__inc_preprocess_1
; preprocess_functions[] = communication_pod_example__inc_preprocess_2

; Set the pod's language.
