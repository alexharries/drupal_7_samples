 Basic styles for the Holiday Search Tiles Paragraphs module.

 Note that we only set basic layout-y stuff here; you will probably want to
 copy either this CSS file or the SCSS file (in the ./scss directory in this
 module) and place it into your theme, where you can customise the layout
 of these holiday tiles.
